# Gympoint App - Backend (NodeJS Express Server), Frontent (ReactJS) and Mobile (React Native)

* In order to use EsLint/Prettier I had to set the `eslint.workingDirectories` config on my .vscode/settings.json (on root directory). It is like this:

```json
    {
        "eslint.workingDirectories": [
            "backend/src"
        ]
    }
```
